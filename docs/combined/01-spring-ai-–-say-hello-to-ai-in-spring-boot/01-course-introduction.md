## Spring AI: From Hello World to Hello LMS

This course will guide you from basic "Hello World" applications to intelligent apps with memory, logic, reasoning, and creativity using Spring AI. Whether you're a backend developer, a Spring Boot enthusiast, or someone exploring AI with tools like ChatGPT, this course is for you.

### Why Spring AI is a Game Changer üöÄ

Spring Boot allows us to build powerful REST APIs, microservices, and full-stack backend applications effortlessly. However, integrating AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) into Spring applications has traditionally been challenging. Spring AI bridges this gap, connecting Java applications to LLMs like OpenAI and Ollama.

Think of Spring AI as giving your backend services a brain üß†. This brain can:

*   Write poetry ‚úçÔ∏è
*   Generate images üñºÔ∏è
*   Answer support tickets üé´
*   Perform intelligent actions autonomously

If you're already a Spring developer, you're 80% of the way to mastering Spring AI. This framework simplifies AI integration, making it feel like configuring a bean rather than battling a black box. Get ready to infuse your Spring Boot apps with AI magic! It's like giving your application a PhD in AI without the tuition fees or caffeine addiction.

### Course Agenda üóìÔ∏è

Here's what we'll cover in this course:

1.  **Basics:**
    *   Build your first Spring AI application with OpenAI models.
    *   Set up LLM models locally using Ollama and Docker.
    *   Deploy LLM models in the cloud with AWS Bedrock.
2.  **Spring AI Essentials:**
    *   Understand prompts and prompt templates.
    *   Stream responses to client applications.
    *   Customize chat interactions with chat options.
    *   Utilize built-in and custom advisors for housekeeping activities.
    *   Explore prompt stuffing to provide context to the LLM.
    *   Convert AI output into structured POJO or JSON formats.
3.  **Generative AI and LLM Foundations:**
    *   Dive into the inner workings of AI and LLM models.
    *   Decode buzzwords like tokens, embeddings, vectors, and attention mechanisms.
    *   Gain a clear understanding of how LLMs work behind the scenes.
4.  **Chat Memory:**
    *   Teach LLMs to remember conversations using Spring AI's chat memory.
    *   Enable LLMs to answer questions effectively using conversation history.
5.  **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):**
    *   Make LLMs answer questions based on provided documents or PDFs.
    *   Learn to chunk, embed, vectorize, and query documents.
    *   Build apps that can search PDFs like a pro.
6.  **Tool Calling:**
    *   Overcome the limitation of LLMs not having real-time data access.
    *   Teach LLMs to check real-time data, query databases, and perform Java code actions.
7.  **Model Context Protocol (MCP):**
    *   Understand MCP, the "USB-C port for AI tools."
    *   Build your own MCP server and interact with other organizations' MCP servers.
    *   Explore both client-side and server-side implementations.
8.  **Unit Testing:**
    *   Implement unit testing for Spring AI applications.
    *   Use evaluators to validate AI responses and catch bad answers at runtime.
    *   Retry sending questions to LLMs if needed.
9.  **Observability:**
    *   Monitor your AI app using Spring Boot Actuator, Prometheus, and Grafana dashboards.
    *   Trace operations using OpenTelemetry (OTLP) and distributed tracing.
10. **Audio and Image Generation:**
    *   Explore scenarios around transcription (audio to text).
    *   Explore scenarios around text to speech (text to audio).
    *   Explore image generation using AI models.

### Prerequisites üìù
