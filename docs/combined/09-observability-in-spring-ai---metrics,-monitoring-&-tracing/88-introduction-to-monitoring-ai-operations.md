## Monitoring AI Operations in Spring AI Applications

This section focuses on understanding how to monitor AI operations within a Spring AI-based application. We'll leverage the Spring Boot Actuator to expose metrics and gain insights into application performance, health, and potential bottlenecks. By the end of this section, you'll understand how to implement observability in a Spring AI application.

### What is Observability? üßê

Observability allows us to understand how our application is running behind the scenes. It's crucial for debugging and resolving issues.

There are three pillars of observability:

*   Logs
*   Metrics
*   Tracing

While we're already familiar with logs (e.g., console output), this section will focus on exposing **metrics** and **tracing** information specific to Spring AI operations.

### Why is Observability Important? üöó

Think of your application like a car. When driving, you constantly monitor:

*   Fuel level
*   Engine temperature
*   Warning lights
*   Speed and RPM

Sometimes, a mechanic uses diagnostic tools to check hidden aspects like engine codes or battery performance.

Similarly, web applications have internal systems that need monitoring using:

*   Metrics
*   Traces
*   AI-specific insights (model usage, latency, failure rates)

The Spring AI framework helps expose this data, enabling us to build monitoring dashboards and alerts.

### What We'll Cover üöÄ

This section will cover the following topics:

1.  Enabling observability in a Spring application.
2.  Understanding the metrics published by the Spring AI framework.
3.  Visualizing metrics using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
4.  Exploring request flows using tracing and spans.

This data will help you troubleshoot, optimize, and scale AI components in real applications.

### Setting Up the Project üõ†Ô∏è

To demonstrate observability, we'll start with a base project.

1.  Create a new folder in your workspace (e.g., "section-9").
2.  Copy the code from "section-6" into this new folder.

    üìù **Note:** We're using the "section-6" project because it includes implementations for RAG, vector store, and tool calling, unlike "section-7" which focuses on MCP.

3.  Use this copied project as the foundation for exploring observability demos.
