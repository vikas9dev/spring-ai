## Understanding Max Messages and Context Window Size in LM Models

As a developer, you might be tempted to configure a large number for max messages (e.g., 1000) to enhance the user experience. However, this decision requires careful consideration due to its implications on context window size and cost.

### Context Window Size Explained üß†

Every Large Language Model (LLM) has a context window size, which represents its "memory span."

*   It determines how much text or tokens the model can process at a time while generating a response.
*   Think of it like a whiteboard with limited space. Once full, older parts must be erased to make room for new information.
*   If the total token count exceeds the context window size, older messages are dropped, and the LLM forgets them.

We send various message types from our Spring application: system messages, user messages, assistant messages, and tool messages.

üìå **Example:** Imagine a user who has been using your application for years. If max messages is set to 1000, all their past messages will be sent to the LLM. All these messages are converted into tokens. If the total token size exceeds the LLM's context window, some messages will be lost because the LLM can only process a limited number of tokens at once.

### Cost Considerations üí∞

The length of input messages directly impacts the number of tokens sent to the LLM.

*   LLM providers charge based on token usage.
*   While $1 per million tokens might seem cheap, consider the scale.
*   If 100 users use your application and 10,000 have long chat histories, you could incur significant costs.

It's crucial to discuss maximum message limits with business stakeholders to find a balance between user experience and cost. Good research and brainstorming are essential.

### Best Practices for Chat Memory Integration ‚úÖ

When integrating chat memory functionality in a Spring application, follow these guidelines:

1.  **Explore Models:** Limit and choose models based on expected conversation length. Different models have varying context window sizes. Smaller, open-source models have smaller context windows compared to commercial models.
2.  **Vector Store Chat Memory Advisor:** For longer chat histories, prefer using vector store chat memory advisors. This allows selecting only relevant past messages instead of the entire history. We'll discuss how vector stores and databases work in future lectures.
3.  **Limit Stored Messages:** By default, Spring keeps the last 20 messages. Adjust this number based on your use case.
4.  **Log and Monitor Token Usage:** Create alerts and notifications to track token usage and prevent exceeding your budget.
5.  **Configure Max Tokens:** As a developer, you can configure the maximum tokens an LLM request can consume using chat options.

    ```java
    // Example of setting max tokens (hypothetical)
    ChatOptions options = new ChatOptions();
    options.setMaxTokens(1000);
    ```

    This ensures requests and responses don't exceed the configured token limit.
6.  **Explore Model Details:** When you want to know about the context window size that is supported by a given LM model, you can explore the same in these website. For example, you can go to models and select these oh four Hyphen mini. In this detail page, you'll be able to see that there is a note that this model is going to have a context window size of 200 tokens.

### Understanding Model Knowledge Cutoff üóìÔ∏è

Most models have a knowledge cutoff date, often a year or more in the past. If a user asks a question about recent events, the LLM might not be able to answer. Advanced concepts like RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), MCP (Memory Context Provider) client, and MCP server can help overcome these limitations, and we'll discuss them later.

### Official Spring AI Documentation üìñ

The official Spring AI documentation provides comprehensive details on chat memory.

*   You can find it in the references section under "Chat Memory."
*   It covers topics like memory storage (in-memory, JDBC), supported databases, and configuration properties.
*   It also details the three types of advisors supported by Spring AI and how to use conversation IDs.

üìù **Note:** While the documentation might seem complex initially, it will become more understandable after completing this course. Explore concepts not covered in the course and make a habit of reading the official documentation.

Spring AI supports these databases to store the chart memory details:

*   Cassandra
*   Neo4j

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Always be cautious of the cost implications when configuring max messages and consider the context window size of the LLM you are using.

üí° **Tip:** Regularly review and adjust your chat memory configurations based on user behavior, cost analysis, and the evolving capabilities of LLMs.
