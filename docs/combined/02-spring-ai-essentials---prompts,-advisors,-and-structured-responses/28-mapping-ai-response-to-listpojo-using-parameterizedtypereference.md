## Handling Complex Requirements: Returning a List of Custom Java Pojo Objects from LLM

So far, we've built REST APIs that return structured output in the form of Java Pojo object lists and map objects. Now, let's explore how to handle more complex requirements.

The goal is to have the LLM return a response as a list of our own custom Java Pojo objects. Previously, our REST API returned a list of strings. Now, we want the LLM to return the output in the format of a list of `CountryCities` objects.

Let's start by copying and pasting the existing REST API. We'll rename the API path to `/chart-bin-list` and the method name to `chartBinList`. We'll also update the return type of the method to `List<CountryCities>`.

This will initially result in a compilation error because the list output converter is only capable of returning structured responses in the form of a list of strings. Our requirement is now more complex: a list of objects from our own custom Pojo class.

Let's try passing the name of the class to the entity, similar to how we might pass `Countries.class`. Something like `List<CountryCities>.class`.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** This won't work in Java due to type erasure. Generics are erased during runtime, so the `CountryCities` information is lost, leading to a compilation error: "Cannot access class object of a parameterized type."

So, how do we resolve this?

To find a solution, let's look for overloaded `entity` methods.

‚úÖ There's an overloaded method that accepts `ParameterizedTypeReference` as an input within the Spring library.

`ParameterizedTypeReference` is a Spring utility class that helps retain generic information at runtime.

üìù **Note:** Behind the scenes, this utility class uses a trick called anonymous subclassing.

Here's how we can use it:

```java
new ParameterizedTypeReference<List<CountryCities>>() {};
```

We don't need to override any methods.

If we examine the syntax, we're passing the generic type, `List<CountryCities>`, to the constructor of `ParameterizedTypeReference`. Since it's an abstract class, we're creating an object of this class using anonymous subclass syntax. The body of the implementation class is empty.

With this approach, the compilation problem should be resolved.

After building the application, we can use Postman to invoke the REST API.

When invoking the API, we can change the message to request country and city details in Europe.

Upon sending the request, we'll receive a list of `CountryCities` objects.

üìå **Example:**

Each object will contain a country name and its cities. The first object might be related to France, followed by Germany, Spain, the UK, the Netherlands, and so on.

Hopefully, it's now clear how to obtain a structured output response from an LLM.

üîë The key is to invoke the `entity` method with `ParameterizedTypeReference`.

All the concepts and examples discussed around the structured output converter are available in the slides for more details.
