## Why Prompt Stuffing Isn't Always the Answer

Let's explore why **prompt stuffing** isn't a viable technique for providing large amounts of data as input to Large Language Models (LLMs). There are two primary limitations: model constraints and billing implications.

### LLM Limitations ü§ñ

LLMs have inherent limitations on the amount of data they can process in a single request.

*   Visit platform.openai.com and navigate to the "Models" section to see the specifications for various models.
*   Each model has a **context window**, which defines the maximum number of **tokens** it can handle for both input and output.
    *   üìå **Example:**  GPT-4.1 might have a context window of 1 million tokens and can generate responses up to 32,768 tokens.
*   Exceeding this context window will result in an error.  While 1 million tokens might accommodate 100-200 pages of data, it's insufficient for thousands of pages.

### Billing Considerations üí∞

Using LLMs from providers like OpenAI, AWS, Google Gemini, or Azure AI Services incurs costs based on **token** consumption.

*   Every request sent to the LLM is converted into **tokens**, and the response is generated from **tokens**.
*   You are charged for both input and output **tokens**.

#### Understanding Tokens üßê

Let's delve into what **tokens** are:

*   Visit platform.openai.com/tokenizer to experiment with tokenization.
*   LLMs don't understand human languages directly; they work with numbers.
*   **Tokenization** converts human language into numerical representations.
    *   üìå **Example:** The phrase "What is the capital of India?" is converted into seven tokens.
    *   üìå **Example:** The phrase "Raining is nice. What do you think of it?" is converted into twelve tokens.
*   Each **token** is associated with a **token ID**.
*   üí° **Tip:** A helpful rule of thumb is that one token generally corresponds to four characters of text, or roughly 3/4 of a word.  Therefore, 100 tokens is approximately 75 words.

```
# Example of tokenization
text = "Hello world!"
# This text might be tokenized into "Hello" and "world!"
```

#### Billing Implications of Prompt Stuffing üí∏

*   Consider an LLM that accepts up to 100 pages of data.
*   If you consistently feed it 100 pages of data with each request using **prompt stuffing**, the cost will be substantial.

### Conclusion ‚úÖ

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Avoid **prompt stuffing** for large amounts of data due to model limitations and high costs.

*   Use **prompt stuffing** only for simple scenarios.
*   Explore advanced techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for more complex use cases.
