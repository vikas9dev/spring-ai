## The Generative AI Journey: From LLMs to Agentic AI

This lecture provides an overview of how generative AI has evolved over the past few years, from simple LLMs to sophisticated Agentic AI systems.

Initially, **LLMs** like ChatGPT were successful because they could answer questions based on their training data. However, these models had limitations:

*   They couldn't answer questions about events after their training period. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** This "knowledge cutoff" was a significant drawback.

To address these limitations, the industry developed several key advancements:

1.  **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: 
    *   RAG allows LLMs to access external data sources, such as private documents or news websites. 
    *   By incorporating real-time information, LLMs can provide more accurate and up-to-date answers. üìù **Note:** RAG enhances the knowledge base of LLMs.

2.  **Tool Calling**: 
    *   Tool calling enables LLMs to interact with external tools and APIs. 
    *   These tools can fetch real-time data (e.g., weather, stock prices) or perform actions (e.g., updating databases, sending emails). üí° **Tip:** Tool calling empowers LLMs to go beyond just providing information.

3.  **AI Agents**: 
    *   An AI agent is an LLM equipped with access to numerous tools and actions. 
    *   AI agents can autonomously make decisions and execute multi-step plans. üìå **Example:** GitHub Copilot is an AI agent that assists with coding tasks.

Let's illustrate the evolution with an example:

*   **LLM (Basic):** "Plan a vacation to London."  The LLM provides general recommendations.
*   **LLM + RAG:** "Plan a vacation to London based on my company policy documents." The LLM considers company policies for better recommendations.
*   **LLM + Tools:** The LLM checks your calendar, flight availability, and hotel options to provide a personalized plan.

An **AI agent** would encompass all these capabilities within a dedicated application, handling the entire vacation planning process autonomously.

```
# Example: AI Agent for Travel Planning
class TravelAgent:
    def __init__(self, llm, calendar_tool, flight_tool, hotel_tool):
        self.llm = llm
        self.calendar_tool = calendar_tool
        self.flight_tool = flight_tool
        self.hotel_tool = hotel_tool

    def plan_vacation(self, destination, company_policy):
        # 1. Use LLM to understand user preferences
        # 2. Use calendar_tool to check availability
        # 3. Use flight_tool to find flights
        # 4. Use hotel_tool to find hotels
        # 5. Consider company_policy
        # 6. Return the best plan
        pass
```

Finally, we arrive at **Agentic AI**:

*   Agentic AI involves multiple AI agents working together to solve complex problems. 
*   üìå **Example:** One agent books flights, another books hotels, and a third arranges transportation.
*   Agentic AI systems are highly intelligent and can handle ambiguous requests. üí° **Tip:** Think of Agentic AI as a team of specialized AI agents.

The generative AI journey can be summarized as follows:

1.  **LLMs:** Sharing knowledge.
2.  **LLMs + RAG:** Sharing personalized knowledge.
3.  **LLMs + Live Data:** Leveraging real-time information.
4.  **LLMs + Actions:** Performing actions.
5.  **AI Agents:** Performing complex actions autonomously.
6.  **Agentic AI:** Solving complex problems collaboratively.

These advancements are leading to more powerful and versatile AI systems. Protocols like MCP are emerging to support the development of Agentic AI.
