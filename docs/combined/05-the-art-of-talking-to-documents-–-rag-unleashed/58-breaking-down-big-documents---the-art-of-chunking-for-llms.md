## Building a Successful RAG Implementation: Document Splitting

To create an effective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) implementation, it's crucial to split your original documents into smaller, manageable chunks before storing them in your vector store. Here's how you can achieve this:

### Document Splitting Process

1.  **Using a Text Splitter:** Employ a text splitter class, such as `TokenTextSplitter`, to divide your documents.

    ```java
    TextSplitter textSplitter = new TokenTextSplitterBuilder()
            .withChunkSize(100)
            .withMaxNumChunks(400)
            .build();
    ```

2.  **Configuring Chunk Size:**
    *   Specify the `chunkSize` to control the approximate size (in tokens) of each document chunk. üìå **Example:** Setting `chunkSize` to 100 means each chunk will contain roughly 100 tokens.
    *   Set `maxNumChunks` to limit the maximum number of tokens in a single document. üìå **Example:** Setting `maxNumChunks` to 400 ensures no document exceeds 400 tokens.

3.  **Splitting Documents:** Use the `split` method of the text splitter to divide your documents into smaller chunks.

    ```java
    List<Document> splittedDocs = textSplitter.split(docs);
    ```

    This will take your original documents (`docs`) and return a list of smaller, split documents (`splittedDocs`).

4.  **Storing Chunks:** Add the resulting smaller documents to your vector store.

### Understanding Chunk Size Parameters

*   **Chunk Size:** This defines the approximate size (in tokens) of each small document generated. The framework will aim for this size.
*   **Max Num Chunks:** This sets the upper limit on the number of tokens a single document can contain.

üìù **Note:** There's also a `withMinimumChunkSizeCache` method that allows you to set a minimum chunk size, but you should be comfortable with the configured `chunkSize` and `maxNumChunks` when using it.

### Optimizing RAG Performance

1.  **Token Consumption:** Splitting documents effectively reduces token consumption, leading to cost savings and faster processing. üìå **Example:** Reducing the number of tokens from 1300 to 531 demonstrates a significant improvement.

2.  **Top K Parameter:** The `topK` parameter determines how many relevant documents are considered for context.

    *   Reducing `topK` can further decrease token usage. üìå **Example:** Changing `topK` from 3 to 2 resulted in a reduction to 41 prompt tokens.
    *   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** It's generally recommended to keep `topK` at least at 3 to provide sufficient context to the LLM for better response quality.

3.  **Finding the Sweet Spot:** Experiment with different `topK` values and chunk size configurations to find the optimal balance between token consumption and response quality for your specific use case. üí° **Tip:** Thorough testing is crucial to identify the best settings for your business requirements.

### Example Scenario

Imagine you ask the question, "Tell me about the notice period." With effective document splitting:

*   The system retrieves only the most relevant documents. üìå **Example:** Documents related to exit policy, leave policy, and new hire probation periods.
*   The LLM receives a focused context, leading to more accurate and efficient responses.
