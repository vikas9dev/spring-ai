## Why RAG is Necessary for Advanced Use Cases

This section details why Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is essential for advanced use cases, especially when dealing with large volumes of proprietary data.

### The Need for RAG üöÄ

As discussed previously, prompt stuffing can lead to challenges, particularly regarding token consumption. RAG addresses this by:

*   Adding only the most relevant information to the prompt.
*   Keeping the prompt compact and focused.
*   Improving accuracy and reducing token waste.

üìù **Note:** This information was covered in a previous lecture but is included here for future reference.

### What Exactly is RAG? ü§î

RAG is a three-step process:

1.  **Retrieval:** Fetching relevant information.
2.  **Augmentation:** Adding the retrieved information to the prompt.
3.  **Generation:** Generating an accurate response using the augmented prompt.

By using the RAG framework, LLMs can access external knowledge, leading to better and more accurate answers.

### RAG in Action: An E-commerce Example üõí

Imagine an e-commerce application like Amazon with millions of documents containing product information (usage, installation, precautions, etc.). This information may not be publicly available, limiting the LLM's ability to answer product-related questions accurately.

With RAG, the scenario changes:

1.  **Retriever:** An end-user asks a question about a product (e.g., "Tell me about product with ID X"). A search operation is performed on the company's product documentation (PDFs, vector database). From millions of documents, the 1-2 most relevant to the product ID are retrieved.
2.  **Augmenter:** The retrieved documents are added to the prompt as context.
3.  **Generation:** The augmented prompt (question + context) is fed to the LLM, which generates an accurate answer.

### RAG Flow Representation üåä

Here's another representation of the RAG flow:

1.  **Retriever:** Documents related to the prompt are searched within a vector database or storage system containing proprietary and non-proprietary documents.
2.  **Augmentation:** The fetched content is added as context to the prompt.
3.  **Generation:** The LLM generates the most accurate response using the entire information.

This flow is designed to be easily understandable, even for non-technical individuals. As developers, our responsibility is to build this RAG framework into our LLM applications.

### Implementing the RAG Framework üõ†Ô∏è

To implement the RAG flow, consider the following steps:

1.  **Load Documents into Vector Database:** Load all proprietary or private documents into a storage system like a vector database.

    ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** There's a specific reason for using a vector database over traditional databases, which will be explained in the next lecture.

2.  **Document Loading Logic:** Write a logic or job to load all the organization's documents into the vector database. This is typically a one-time activity, but updated documents can be reloaded as needed.

    ```
    # Example: Pseudo-code for document loading
    def load_documents_to_vector_db(documents, vector_db):
        for doc in documents:
            vector_db.insert(doc)
    ```

3.  **Document Chunking:** Original documents often have hundreds of pages covering multiple topics. Instead of loading them as-is, split them into smaller document chunks.

    üìå **Example:** A 1000-page document (D1) can be split into 1000 different document chunks. A 100-page document (D2) can be split into 100 document chunks.

4.  **Embeddings Calculation:** Calculate the embedded value for each document chunk.

5.  **Store Embeddings:** Store the calculated embedded values inside the vector store.

    üí° **Tip:** This may seem complex, but it's achievable using frameworks like Spring. A demo will be provided in future lectures.

    üìù **Note:** Ensure you're clear about the document loader's purpose. Without loading documents into the vector store, search operations will return zero results.

### RAG Implementation Flow in a Spring Application ‚öôÔ∏è

Once all organization documents are loaded into the vector store, the RAG framework can be implemented.

1.  **End-User Question:** The end-user asks a question to the Spring application.
2.  **Search for Similar Documents:** Based on the question, a search for similar documents is performed.
3.  **Context Augmentation:** The information received from the search is added as context to the prompt.
4.  **LLM Response:** The LLM uses the relevant information to respond to the end-user with an accurate answer.

The document loading steps (1, 2, 3) are usually a one-time activity or re-executed only when new or updated documents need to be stored in the vector store.

### Why Vector Store? ü§î

The next lecture will explain why documents should be stored in a vector store rather than traditional databases like SQL or NoSQL databases.
