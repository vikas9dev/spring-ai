## Understanding Generative AI and Language Models

This section provides a foundational understanding of Generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), and related concepts. It's designed to equip you with the necessary knowledge to effectively utilize Spring AI in more advanced use cases.

If you're already familiar with AI and LLM concepts, feel free to skip this section. Review the provided slides; if the concepts are clear, proceed to the next section. Otherwise, I highly recommend going through this material.

📝 **Note:** This section focuses on theory and does not cover Spring AI directly.

The goal is to ensure that as a Spring AI developer, you possess a basic understanding of:

*   What Generative AI is.
*   What LLMs are.
*   How LLMs work internally.

For instance, we'll explore concepts like embeddings, vector stores, and vector databases. A solid grasp of LLMs and Generative AI is essential for understanding these topics.

Let's dive into Generative AI!

### The Journey to Generative AI

Generative AI isn't a recent overnight phenomenon. It's the result of a long history of technological advancements.

Think of Generative AI as a super-smart artist or writer that uses computers to create new things: stories, images, videos, ideas, and responses to our questions. 🤖 It's like a robot that can draw a picture or write a poem on its own. 🎨✍️

Generative AI is part of a larger family of technologies that help computers think and learn. This family includes:

*   Artificial Intelligence (AI)
*   Machine Learning (ML)
*   Deep Learning (DL)
*   Neural Networks
*   Natural Language Processing (NLP)
*   Large Language Models (LLMs)

Let's look at how these technologies evolved:

1.  **1950s:** Artificial Intelligence (AI) emerged as a computer science field.
2.  **1990s:** Machine Learning (ML) developed as a subset of AI.
3.  **2010s:** Deep Learning (DL) gained prominence.
4.  **2020s:** Generative AI (GenAI) came into the picture.

Here's another way to visualize this family tree:

*   **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** The "grandparent" or "super parent" 👵👴
*   **Machine Learning (ML):** A branch of AI. 🌳
*   **Deep Learning (DL):** A branch of ML. 🌳
*   **Generative AI (GenAI):** A branch of DL. 🌳
    *   **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Focus on generating text. ✍️
    *   **Image Generation Models:** Create images. 🖼️
    *   **Video Generation Models:** Create videos. 🎬
    *   **Code Generation Models:** Create code. 💻

Parallel to this evolution, other major fields have also developed:

*   **Data Science:** Combines mathematics, statistics, programming, and domain knowledge to extract meaningful insights from data. 📊 It's largely used to make predictions based on historical data.
*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Enables us to interact with these technologies using natural language like English. 🗣️ When we ask questions to Generative AI, NLP is used to understand our instructions.

I hope this provides a basic understanding of the family tree of Generative AI. In the next lecture, we'll explore these technologies in more detail.
