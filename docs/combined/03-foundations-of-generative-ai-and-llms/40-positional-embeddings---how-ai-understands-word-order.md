## Understanding Positional Encoding in Transformer Models

The "Attention is All You Need" paper introduced a new transformer architecture that is foundational for building efficient Language Model (LM) models. This architecture relies heavily on the concept of **positional encoding**.

The process begins with input embeddings, which are static embeddings calculated during training and stored as part of the model's vocabulary. 

Before these embeddings are fed into the transformer model, an additional step called **positional encoding** is applied. Let's delve into why this is crucial.

### The Importance of Positional Encoding üìç

Consider these two sentences:

1.  The cat sat on the mat.
2.  The mat sat on the cat.

Both sentences contain the same words, but their meanings are drastically different due to the order of the words. The position of words significantly impacts the overall meaning of a sentence.

To address this, positional encoding is used. For example, in the first sentence, the word "cat" is at position two. This positional information is conveyed to the LM model by adding positional embedding details to the initial token embedding.

The algorithm retrieves the static embedding value of "cat" from the model's vocabulary and adds the corresponding positional embedding value. The resulting updated token embedding is then passed as input to the LM model.

This final vector captures both:

*   The meaning from the static embedding.
*   The position details from the positional embedding.

### Why Positional Encoding is Necessary ‚ùì

A common question arises: If LM models process sentences in parallel, why is positional information needed?

The answer is that LM models **do not** process tokens sequentially. They process all words or tokens in parallel to achieve efficiency. Therefore, knowing the position of each token is essential.

This final vector, enriched with positional information, is fed into the transformer architecture to resolve potential ambiguities.

üìå **Example:** Consider the sentence, "He went to the bank to deposit the money." and "She sat by the bank of the river." The word "bank" has different meanings based on context.

However, positional embeddings alone cannot fully resolve the ambiguity of the word "bank". They provide positional context, but the **attention layers** within the transformer architecture are crucial for understanding the actual meaning by examining the surrounding words.

We will explore these attention layers in the next section.
