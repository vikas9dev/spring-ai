## Generative AI Overview

Generative AI encompasses various types of models, each with its own strengths and expertise. Some models excel at generating text, while others are proficient in creating images, videos, or code.

Broadly, there are two main types of models:

*   Large Language Models (LLMs)
*   Diffusion Models

### Large Language Models (LLMs)

These models are primarily used for text generation.

ðŸ“Œ **Example:** ChatGPT and Llama.

LLMs are widely used in the industry for tasks like code generation and answering questions.

### Diffusion Models

These models are capable of generating video, image, and audio content.

ðŸ“Œ **Example:** Dall-E 2, Midjourney, and Sora.

From the next lecture, we will focus on LLMs because they are extensively used in enterprise applications to solve business problems. While some applications may utilize diffusion models for image and video generation, the majority of this course will cover leveraging LLMs. We will explore examples of image, video, and audio generation towards the end of the course.

### How Diffusion Models Generate Images

Let's briefly explore how diffusion models generate images, videos, or other data. Diffusion models use a specific technique:

1.  **Training:** The models are trained on a large dataset of images.
    ðŸ“Œ **Example:** A dog image.
2.  **Adding Noise:** During training, the model progressively adds noise (pixel data) to the original image.
3.  **Iteration:** After multiple iterations of adding noise, the original image transforms into a completely noisy image (similar to static on a television).
4.  **Learning:** By analyzing numerous images, the diffusion models learn how to construct new images.
5.  **Reverse Process (Generation):** To generate a sample image based on instructions, the model performs the reverse process.
    *   It starts with a completely noisy image.
    *   The noise is gradually decreased.
    *   The pixel data is arranged in such a way that the desired image (e.g., a dog) begins to appear.
6.  **Final Image:** After multiple iterations of denoising, a perfect image is generated by the diffusion model.

I hope you now have a basic understanding of how diffusion models generate images. This is the current technique used by these models, but advancements are continuously being made.
